Any nav project need 2 major transofmr. Map -> odom -> base_link.

nav2 provide acml (adaptive monte-carlo) for locolization (map->odom). Provide `robot locolization` for sensor fusion on odometry (odom-base_link)


## Given by Hello Robot

The `stretch_nav2` package already gives some launch file for us.


* `navigation.launch.py` 
    * launches robot driver, teleop, rviz, lidar, 
    * and `stretch_nav2/launch/bringup_launch.py`
        * `stretch_nav2/launch/bringup_launch.py` uses the `stretch_nav2/config/nav2_params.yaml`
        * launch `nav2_bringup/launch`: `slam_launch.py` or `locolization_launch.py` 
        * launch `stretch_nav2/launch/navigation_launch.py`


* `navigation_launch.py` is a wrapper that bring up many ros2 nodes.
    * defines two sets of remap 
        * /cmd_val -> /stretch/cmd_val , /tf -> tf 
    * Param file from `nav2_bringup/params/nav2_params.yaml`
    * Launches nodes: nav2_controller , nav2_planner,  nav2_behaviors, nav2_bt_navigator, nav2_waypoint_follower, nav2_lifecycle_manager. 


The `navigation.launch` stack will either include acml or slam toolbox. Since we will use rtabmap for all of these, We only need the content in `navigation_launch.py`. 

### Provided nav2 param file

There are two nav2 param given in `stretch_nav2` one is nav2_voxel_params, the other is nav2_params. 

They are differ in local_costmap.
* nav2_voxel_params uses plugins: "obstacle_layer", "inflation_layer", "stvl_layer"
* nav2_params uses plugins: "obstacle_layer", "voxel_layer", "inflation_layer"

both: 
* `obstacle_layer` uses scan type, with topic `/scan_filtered`

* Inflation layer have difference on param: 
    * the voxel param uses inflation_radius 0.25 
    * the nav2_param uses inflation_radius 0.55

nav2_param have unique `voxel_layer` 
* plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::VoxelLayer", 
    * using scan: topic /scan_filtered, with some ray tracing param.

Nav2_voxel use stvl_layer (https://github.com/SteveMacenski/spatio_temporal_voxel_layer?tab=readme-ov-file)
* plugin: `spatio_temporal_voxel_layer/SpatioTemporalVoxelLayer` 
    * uses pointcloud, topic: `/camera/depth/color/points`

According to introduction from stvl_layer, it seems to be a better option for depth camera that uses less CPU time.


## Missing package

The `stvl_layer` seems very nice, however it is not in the standard nav2 plugins. Thus it requires installing of additional package `ros-humble-spatio-temporal-voxel-layer`. Without this, costmap2D object will error out during bring up (some other stuff of it will still function, but you will miss some important features that cause bt_navigator to fail to bring up)
