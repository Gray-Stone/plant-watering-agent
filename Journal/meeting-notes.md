## Forgot flowerpot 

Check training data's prediction, model should be very good at seeing the object in train data.

Likely issue in training method, formatting data.




## Worse case check

Try this as first thing.

Train it on cats and dogs (or anything) to show it can do 2 different classes.

Pot and Flower might be better

Train it with large data, then reduce data, see if it fail at low amount of data (at level I have labeled the watering area with)
