## Use the correct label ID

The pre-trained yolo model have 80 classes already, including the potted plant we want.


According to this post: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/10057, to keep on adding to the pre-trained model with custom classes, one need to start with the id after last id in pre-trained module

I have forked `labelme2yolo` to add ability to specify the class id for it. https://github.com/Gray-Stone/labelme2yolo-mod.

A renaming problem with this is YOLO doesn't like it when label number jumped:

```
error ‚ùå '1-class dataset requires class indices 0-0, but you have invalid class indices 58-58 defined in your dataset YAML.'
```

So I need to copy the leading labels from COCO dataset into the file to pad it.

## Rename the label class


Here is the instruction for swapping out custom names.

The catch is the renaming must be done from the tensor side. changeing it in YOLO doesn't affect anything.
