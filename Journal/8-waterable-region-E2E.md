Since when watering a plant, we always look from top down to the plant. Visually make sure we see the soil bit. Then water onto the soil.

A btm up view of the flower pot is useless for finding out how to water.

We could do a simple segmentation model that find out the image inner bit of the pot, specially where the soil is to water on.
